# The Clean Sheet
Character Sheet for 5E, including the source files

To change the workings of the sheet: 
  - Edit the JavaScript files.
  - Import the files into the PDF using Acrobat.

To change the layout: 
  - Edit the InDesign file (mind the layers).
  - Run custom scripts to change the formatting and validations of the elements in Acrobat (check out my PDF Helper repo).
  - Import the Javascript files into the PDF using Acrobat.
  
I'm no longer working on this sheet, *so feel free to edit it, fork it etc*. Have fun!

Please realise this was my first applied coding, ever.
